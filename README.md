### What

Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the world, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents. Turns rotate among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and, in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple days to finish. European versions are structured so that each player has a limited "secret mission" objective that shortens the game.

Based on Board Game "War" by Grow, widely know as "Risk" or "La Conquête du Monde"

### Why

As a group of friends were playing War in its online version, we came across with many ideas and improvements to the game, here is a quick list and goals we want to adress with this project:

- Team mode <br>
  When playing with 5 or 6 players we often created teams and tried to win with one goal or another, having a   Team mode makes this interaction easier and just one Goal for both
  
- Alliances <br>
  Having a contract for X time of rounds is a fair and simple way to set alliances and encourage conversations   while playing the game
  
- Winning just at the end of the round <br>
  Giving players time to adress an enemy wins makes the game more dinamic, as the enemy has to plan well his     last round, and the players can adress the situation together as everyone knows what is about happen
  
- More maps <br>
  World map and Roman empire is awesome, but South/North america and other regions would be even better
  
- HTML5 and Javascript ES6 <br>
  War was made in Flash, having a HTML5 and ES6 option is not just faster, but more reliable and compatible     with new version of browsers deactivating Flash
  
- Events <br>
  Wars, Tsunamis, Pandemics, and world events makes the game more dinamic and fun to play as the game is never   predictable and no one have sure of winning a game

MEXT comes from Monbukagakusho, a Japanese scholarships that brought everyone together
